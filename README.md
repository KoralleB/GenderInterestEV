# Across Early Policy and Market Contexts Women and Men Show Similar Interest in Electric Vehicles

## Abstract

While ownership and purchase of all motor vehicles approach gender parity, to date electric vehicles (EV) are being purchased by far more men than women. 
Prior analysis of data from California finds no reason why this difference should persist. 
This report extends that analysis across 12 other US states with varying EV policy and market contexts. 
Via nominal logistic regression modeling of a survey conducted in 2014, the early market days for EVs, 
differences in prospective interest in EVs between female and male respondents are examined. 
Overall, no difference between women and men rises to the level of the observed differences in real EV markets, 
regardless of any variation in zero-emission vehicle policy and market contexts. 
However, some differences in motivations to purchase an EV are measured. 
In this presentation, we will discuss the similarity and differences in interest and motivations between men and women.

This is an NCST research report written by Kenneth S. Kurani and Koral Buch.
